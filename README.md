Welcome! This project has been automatically generated by [Anima](https://animaapp.com/).

## Getting started

> **Prerequisites:**
> The following steps require [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) to be installed on your system, so please
> install it beforehand if you haven't already.

To get started with your project, you'll first need to install the dependencies with:

```
npm install
```

## Running the Full Stack Application

### Prerequisites
- Node.js installed
- Python 3.8+ installed
- OpenAI API key

### Setup Backend
1. Navigate to backend folder and install dependencies:
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Create `.env` file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

3. Add your OpenAI API key to `.env`:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```

### Run Both Frontend and Backend

**Option 1: Run both together (Recommended)**
```bash
npm run dev:all
```

**Option 2: Run separately**

Terminal 1 (Frontend):
```bash
npm run dev
```

Terminal 2 (Backend):
```bash
npm run backend
```

After a few seconds:
- Frontend: [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/)
- Backend API: [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/)
- API Docs: [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)


If you are satisfied with the result, you can finally build the project for release with:

```
npm run build
```
